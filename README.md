```

## 2 - edit /settings.js
```
    Edit the settings.js file to your flavor.  
    Enter your TLD.  
    The color array will be used by the randomized color picker, yo can add as many color
    (gradient)s as you like.  
    Set the background image that will partly show through the randomized colors. This can be any image, gif or nft.  
    Last but not least, set your hnschat name for your support channel.  
```

```
    All colors are brought back to some css variables.

    #tip: Use VScode's built-in color picker and change the color-scheme in seconds!
```

```
